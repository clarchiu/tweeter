# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This application leverages Express on the server-side. Currently it is limited to an in-memory database, hopefully it will be expanded on eventually. The primary purpose of this app was to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
